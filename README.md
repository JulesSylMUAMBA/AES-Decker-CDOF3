# Project Title

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

***Cryptography_Project_AES***

Author : Mathys Decker (Group 15)

Simple AES implementation for a cryptography project

usage: AES [-h] [-E] [-D] [-kr size] [-kb hex] [-kt text] [-dr size] [-dt text] [-df path]\
           [-ob] [-ot] [-of path]

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

MODE:
  Choose one of the following modes

  -E          Encryption mode\
  -D          Decryption mode

KEY:
  Choose one of the following commands to insert the key

  -kr size    Key from size of a randomly generated byte array (size >= 16)\
  -kb hex     Key from bytes in hexadecimal format\
  -kt text    Key from text

DATA:
  Choose one of the following commands to insert the data to be encrypted / decrypted

  -dr size    Data from size of a randomly generated byte array\
  -dt text    Data from text\
  -df path    Data from file using a path

OUTPUT:
  Choose on of the following commands to output / save the result

  -ob         Output bytes\
  -ot         Output text\
  -of path    Output file to a path
